        "content": "Tom Brady, in his first year away from the Patriots infrastructure and the spectre of Bill Belicheck at the ripe age of 43, took a 7-9 Buccaneers team to Super Bowl LV. They were set to face the inevitable Chiefs team... but what happened? Tom Brady threw for 3 more touchdowns and 2 fewer interceptions than Patrick Mahomes, resulting in a 31-9 victory. Besides the obvious, Tom Brady is now 6 rings ahead of Mahomes rather than only 4 rings ahead. Tom Brady is 2-0 against Mahomes in their playoff match-ups. This would be like if Washington Wizards' version of Michael Jordan was able to play early-prime LeBron James in the finals and routed him 4-0 in a sweep. It's over. The speculation was fun. Mahomes may yet be able to become the BOAT, the most-talented, coolest-looking-at-no-look-passing quarterback we have ever seen, but make no mistake. His chances to be the GOAT died yesterday.",

        "content": "Just 13 short years after the ESPN broadcast of LeBron's announcement to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to go to the Miami, it has become clear that through the lens of relativism, LeBron was unnecessarily ridiculed. It has become commonplace for lesser NBA superstars to do far worse by their teams. The same year that KD signed a max extension with the Brooklyn Nets, he requested a trade to the Suns. Ben Simmons, formerly of the Philadelphia 76ers, is not injured and refused to play for his team when all they did was be critical of his poor play in games 5-7 of the Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Hawks. LeBron honored his entire contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He gave them ample time and opportunity to make the squad around him good enough to win a championship, but they failed, and as a steward of his own legacy and dreams, he decided to take matters into his own hands and go where he knew he could win. The Heatles and the Decision were good for the NBA. I believe we would all be much happier in this zenith of the player empowerment era if just a few more guys did like LeBron and played out their entire contracts with the teams they signed their deals with.",
