        "content": "Tom Brady, in his first year away from the Patriots infrastructure and the spectre of Bill Belicheck at the ripe age of 43, took a 7-9 Buccaneers team to Super Bowl LV. They were set to face the inevitable Chiefs team... but what happened? Tom Brady threw for 3 more touchdowns and 2 fewer interceptions than Patrick Mahomes, resulting in a 31-9 victory. Besides the obvious, Tom Brady is now 6 rings ahead of Mahomes rather than only 4 rings ahead. Tom Brady is 2-0 against Mahomes in their playoff match-ups. This would be like if Washington Wizards' version of Michael Jordan was able to play early-prime LeBron James in the finals and routed him 4-0 in a sweep. It's over. The speculation was fun. Mahomes may yet be able to become the BOAT, the most-talented, coolest-looking-at-no-look-passing quarterback we have ever seen, but make no mistake. His chances to be the GOAT died yesterday.",
