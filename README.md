## Description <a name="description"></a> 
This project is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish blogs and comment on other developers' posts as well. This project follows an MVC architecture. Handlebars.js is the templating language, Sequelize is the ORM and expression-session npm package was used for authentication.
